# Hi there, I'm Walter 👋
### AI Engineer & Data Scientist

I design and build AI systems with a strong focus on **engineering judgment, computational efficiency, and real-world constraints**.  
Rather than chasing model complexity or trends, I prioritize **well-founded design decisions**, clear trade-offs, and solutions that remain robust outside controlled environments.

My interests span Data Science, Optimization, All fields of AI and, also Neuro-Symbolic AI, with a particular emphasis on systems that must operate reliably in high-impact or noisy contexts.

## 🛠️ Engineering Philosophy

* **Trade-offs over dogma:** There is no universally “best” model — only solutions that fit a specific problem, constraint set, and context.
* **Efficiency is a feature:** Runtime, scalability, and simplicity matter. A simpler algorithm that converges faster is often the better engineering choice.
* **Understanding before scaling:** I value knowing *why* a system behaves as it does before pushing for performance or deployment.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🏥 AI Systems in Healthcare
*Engineering under strict reliability and decision-cost constraints.*

| Project | Tech Stack | Key Engineering Decision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Bayesian Heart Failure Predictor](./link-to-repo)** | Python, MCMC (Custom) | **Decision Thresholding:** Tuned for **zero false positives** to reflect clinical resource constraints. Implemented Metropolis-Hastings from scratch to model uncertainty explicitly. |
| **[Cardiolog: Neuro-Symbolic Diagnostic Tool](./link-to-repo)** | Python, Prolog (s(CASP)) | **Hybrid Design:** Combined statistical learning with logic-based reasoning to support structured, inspectable medical decision processes. |

### ⚡ Optimization & Algorithmic Complexity
*Metaheuristics for NP-Hard problems.*

* **[Mars Ecosystem Optimizer (Maximum Diversity Problem)](./link-to-repo)**
  * **Problem:** Biological selection simulation modeled as an NP-Hard optimization task.
  * **Approach:** Benchmarked trajectory-based and population-based metaheuristics.
  * **Result:** **Simulated Annealing** matched Genetic Algorithm solution quality while reducing runtime from **15s to 0.05s**, highlighting the impact of algorithm selection under time constraints.
  * **Stack:** Java, Metaheuristics Frameworks.

### 🧠 NLP & Applied Research
*Adapting models to linguistic and computational realities.*

* **[Political Ideology Classification (Spanish Twitter)](./link-to-repo)**
  * **Focus:** Transformer adaptation (BETO) for high-slang, high-sarcasm political discourse.
  * **Analysis:** Compared SVMs, LSTMs, and Transformers, evaluating accuracy gains against computational cost.
  * **Stack:** Python, Hugging Face, Scikit-learn.

## 🌍 Beyond Code

I actively engage in **AI dissemination and community-driven initiatives**, particularly around:
- critical thinking about AI-generated content,
- misinformation and automated persuasion,
- and the social impact of deployed AI systems.

I am a member of an Artificial Intelligence association and have participated in the organization of talks and interactive events on **fake news and AI**, aimed at helping non-technical audiences understand how modern AI systems influence information and decision-making.

## 💻 Technical Toolkit

* **Languages:** Python (Advanced), Java, Prolog, SQL  
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers  
* **Optimization:** Metaheuristics, Simulated Annealing, GRASP  
* **Reasoning Systems:** Logic Programming, Neuro-Symbolic AI

## 🤝 Collaboration

I’m especially interested in collaborating on projects that:
- involve non-trivial engineering or algorithmic trade-offs,
- operate under real-world constraints (time, data quality, interpretability, risk),
- or aim to apply AI in socially relevant or high-impact domains.
