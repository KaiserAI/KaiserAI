# Hi there, I'm [Tu Nombre] 👋
### Software Engineer & Data Scientist | Focused on Interpretable AI & Optimization

I build robust, production-grade systems that solve complex engineering problems. My work prioritizes **business value, algorithmic efficiency, and model interpretability** over black-box complexity.

Currently applying rigorous engineering principles to Data Science and Neuro-Symbolic AI.

## 🛠️ Engineering Philosophy

* **Explainability First:** In critical domains like Healthcare, a correct prediction is useless if the "why" is a mystery.
* **Efficiency > Hype:** I choose the right tool for the job. Sometimes a well-tuned Simulated Annealing beats a Genetic Algorithm by 17% in runtime.
* **From Scratch:** I don't just import libraries; I implement core algorithms (like MCMC or Metaheuristics) to understand their statistical boundaries.
