# Hi there, I'm Walter 👋
### AI Engineer & Data Scientist

I design and build AI systems with a strong focus on **engineering judgment, computational efficiency, and real-world constraints**.  

Rather than chasing model complexity or trends, I prioritize **well-founded design decisions**, clear trade-offs, and solutions that remain robust outside controlled environments.

My interests span Applied Machine Learning, Optimization, and Neuro-Symbolic AI, with a particular emphasis on **healthcare, biomedical decision-making, and other domains where uncertainty and error costs matter**.

## 🛠️ Engineering Philosophy

* **Trade-offs over dogma:** There is no universally “best” model — only solutions that fit a specific problem, constraint set, and context.
* **Efficiency is a feature:** Runtime, scalability, and simplicity matter. A simpler algorithm that converges faster is often the better engineering choice.
* **Understanding before scaling:** I value knowing *why* a system behaves as it does before pushing for performance or deployment.

## 🚀 Selected Projects

### 🏥 AI Systems in Healthcare
*Engineering under strict reliability, uncertainty, and decision-cost constraints.*

| Project | Focus | Key Engineering Decision |
|------|------|------|
| **[Bayesian Heart Failure Predictor](https://github.com/KaiserAI/Bayesian-Heart-Failure-Clinical-Risk-Prediction-with-Uncertainty-Quantification)** | Clinical risk prediction | **Decision thresholding under uncertainty:** Tuned for zero false positives to reflect clinical resource constraints. Custom MCMC (Metropolis–Hastings) to model uncertainty explicitly. |
| **[Cardiolog – Neuro-Symbolic Diagnostic Tool](https://github.com/KaiserAI/Cardiolog.git)** | Explainable medical reasoning | **Hybrid architecture:** Combined statistical learning with logic-based reasoning to support structured, inspectable clinical decisions. |

---

### ⚡ Optimization & Algorithmic Design  
*Solving complex problems where algorithm choice matters.*

* **[Mars Ecosystem Optimizer – Maximum Diversity Problem](https://github.com/KaiserAI/Mars-Ecosystem-Optimizer-Maximum-Diversity-Problem-Solver.git)**
  * Modeled a biological selection process as an NP-Hard optimization problem.
  * Benchmarked trajectory-based vs. population-based metaheuristics.
  * **Result:** Simulated Annealing matched Genetic Algorithm solution quality while reducing runtime from **15s to 0.05s**, highlighting the impact of algorithm selection under tight constraints.
  * **Stack:** Java, Metaheuristics.

---

### 🧠 NLP & Applied ML  
*Adapting models to linguistic, social, and computational realities.*

* **[Political Ideology Classification (Spanish Twitter)](https://github.com/KaiserAI/Political-Ideology-Classification-in-Tweets.git)**
  * Adapted BETO for high-noise, high-sarcasm political discourse.
  * Compared SVMs, LSTMs, and Transformers, evaluating performance gains against computational cost.
  * **Focus:** Robustness over benchmark chasing.

---

### 🛡️ Generative AI & Security  
*Understanding failure modes before deployment.*

| Project | Focus | Engineering Trade-off |
|------|------|------|
| **[MegaCorp – Local LLM Red Teaming Platform](https://github.com/KaiserAI/Hacking-LLM-Local.git)** | Prompt injection & model misuse | **Privacy vs. latency:** Fully local inference (LLaMA 3.2 via Ollama) to eliminate data leakage risks while optimizing context length for interactivity. |

## 🌍 Beyond Code

I actively engage in **AI dissemination and community-driven initiatives**, particularly around critical thinking about AI and the social impact of deployed AI systems.

I am the president of an [Artificial Intelligence association](https://asociacion-ia.github.io/aiaweb/) and have participated in talks and interactive events on aimed at helping both technical and non-technical audiences understand how modern AI works.

---

## 🤝 Collaboration

I’m especially interested in collaborating on projects that aim to apply AI in socially relevant or high-impact domains.
